# vehicle-collision-detection-system
IOT based vehicle collision detection system using Adafruit fona and sim808 GPRS/GPS/BT module

Hardweare used
1.Arduino Uno
2.GSM GPS GPRS Shield for Arduino UNO Mega SIM808 with Bluetooth
3.Shock Sensor
4.GY-61 DXL335 3-Axis Accelerometer Module 

This shield connects your Arduino to a cellular GSM Network! It also includes an onboard GPS and Bluetooth Module. It directly plugs onto your Arduino and allows you to send/receive SMS, make/answer calls, access internet through GPRS, get GPS Coordinates, etc. The shield includes all hardware required for your Arduino based GSM + GPS Projects - GSM/GPRS Module, GPS Module, SIM Card Holder, Cellular Antenna, GPS Antenna headphone connector, etc. It greatly simplifies your GSM project and allows you to kick start your GSM and GPS project using the Arduino. Library to handle SMS, Calls, GPRS, DTMF decoding is available and greatly simplifies your project code.

The shield uses SIM808Module. AT commands are used to configure and communicate with the shield. All communication with the shield is through serial interface. The shield allows you to use a software serial port on your Arduino.
